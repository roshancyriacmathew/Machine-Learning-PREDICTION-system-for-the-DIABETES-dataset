# Machine-Learning-PREDICTION-system-for-the-DIABETES-dataset
The main objective of the diabetes prediction dataset is to create a machine-learning prediction system to 
diagnostically detect whether a patient has diabetes based on the diagnostic measurements in the dataset.
We will be covering exploratory data analysis, performing feature engineering, experimenting with different machine
learning models, and then using the best model to build a prediction system.
